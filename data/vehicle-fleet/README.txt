notebooks in this folder create the stock data as required from the inputs provided by AEMDA.

Run them in the following order:

1. return_numveh95 must be done FIRST as the others all depend on these
2. run the other three in any order - return_newveh95, return_TOT95, return_totnumveh95. they are independent of one another
3. run return_non95_tables to produce the non95 tables (as it suggests)
